Listen Radar is a blog site dedicated to reviewing the latest headphones and earbuds in the market. Our reviews are based on in-depth research, hands-on testing, and a passion for music. Our goal is to help our readers make informed decisions when purchasing headphones and earbuds that best suit their needs and preferences.

This repository contains the source code for the Listen Radar website (https://listenradar.com/). The website is built using a modern web development stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework. We also use Jekyll, a static site generator, to automate the website's build process and to make it easy to maintain and update the content.

In addition to the website code, this repository also includes a collection of images and other assets used in our reviews. We believe that high-quality visuals are essential to give readers a clear idea of what they can expect from a particular headphone or earbud.
